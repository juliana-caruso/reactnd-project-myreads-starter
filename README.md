# MyReads Project - Udacity React Fundamental course

This is my approach to 'MyReads Project' for Udacity's React course. 
This app consists in a bookshelf that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Installation

To install / use the application:

```bash
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
```

## Backend Server

The backend server was provided and has limitations such as using using a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).


## Contributing

This App was created based on a provided repository/starter code for _all_ Udacity students.
